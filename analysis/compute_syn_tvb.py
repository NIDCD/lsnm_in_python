# compute_syn_tvb.py
#
# Calculate and plot simulated synaptic activities in given ROIs, using simulation
# output from The Virtual Brain Simulator exclusively. Used as a control for LSNM+TVB
# simulation of delay-match-to-sample task.
# 
# It also saves the synaptic activities for each and all modules in a python data file
# (*.npy)
# The data is saved in a numpy array with columns in the following order:
#
# V1 ROI (right hemisphere, includes only TVB nodes) 
# V4 ROI (right hemisphere, includes only TVB nodes)
# IT ROI (right hemisphere, includes only TVB nodes)
# FS ROI (right hemisphere, includes only TVB nodes)
# D1 ROI (right hemisphere, includes only TVB nodes)
# D2 ROI (right hemisphere, includes only TVB nodes)
# FR ROI (right hemisphere, includes only TVB nodes)
# LIT ROI (left hemisphere, includes only TVB nodes)

# the following ranges define the location of the nodes within a given ROI in Hagmann's brain.
# They were taken from the excel document:
#       "Hagmann's Talairach Coordinates (obtained from TVB).xlsx"

# indices given by the above document by one location.
