# compute_syn_visual_66_regions.py
#
# Calculate and plot simulated synaptic activities in 33 ROIs (right hemisphere)
# as defined by Haggman et al
# 
# ... using data from visual delay-match-to-sample simulation (or resting state simulation
# of the same duration as the DMS).
# It also saves the synaptic activities for 33 ROIs (right hemisphere) in a python data file
# (*.npy)
# The data is saved in a numpy array where the columns are the 33 ROIs:
#

import numpy as np

import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

import matplotlib as mpl

# set matplot lib parameters to produce visually appealing plots
mpl.style.use('ggplot')

# define the name of the output file where the integrated synaptic activity will be stored
syn_file = 'synaptic_in_66_ROIs.npy'

# the following ranges define the location of the nodes within a given ROI in Hagmann's brain.
# They were taken from the excel document:
#       "Location of visual LSNM modules within Connectome.xlsx"
# Extracted from The Virtual Brain Demo Data Sets
