<h1></h1>

<p>Python version of LSNM (Large-Scale Neural Modeling software).
This repository contains the following directories:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>stimuli_creation: Scripts to create stimuli for simulation</p></li>
<li><p>simulation: Scripts to simulate neural models</p></li>
<li><p>analysis: Scripts to analyze simulated</p></li>
<li><p>visualization: Scripts to visualize simulated data</p></li>
<li><p>auditory_model: Husain et al (2004)'s auditory model</p></li>
<li><p>visual_model: Tagamets and Horwitz (1998)'s visual model</p></li>
</ul>

<p>To execute this software you will need to
have the following installed on your local machine or server:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>Python 2.7 for any platform (so far tested on Mac OS and
 RedHat Linux). Please note that python LSNM is NOT compatible
 with either Python 2.6 or Python 3.0.</p></li>
<li><p>Python modules matplotlib, re, random, math, numpy, sys, and
 PyQt4, pandas, among other scientific computation modules. My
 advice is to download Anaconda Python, freely available
 from continuum.io, which contains Python 2.7 and a full set
 of modules commonly used in scientific computation.</p></li>
<li><p>The Virtual Brain Python modules, located at the TVB github
 repository at <a href="https://github.com/the-virtual-brain">https://github.com/the-virtual-brain</a>. You will
 need to clone the directories 'tvb-library' and 'tvb-data'
 and install it locally so that your Python installation is
 able to see the location of such modules. Please refer to the
 instructions provided in the github repository on how to cleanly
 install TVB. Also, refer to the 'Alternate installation: the user
 scheme' at <a href="https://docs.python.org/2/install/">https://docs.python.org/2/install/</a>, for
 instructions on how to install python modules locally when
 you don't have 'write' permission to global-site packages (e.g.,
 you are only a user in a Unix system an do not have a 'root'
 or 'su' password. If the ‘Alternate installation’ does not work, please
 refer to the “Installing Python modules” in the lsnm_in_python
 wiki page, at <a href="https://github.com/NIDCD/lsnm_in_python/wiki/Installing-Python-modules">https://github.com/NIDCD/lsnm_in_python/wiki/Installing-Python-modules</a>.</p></li>
