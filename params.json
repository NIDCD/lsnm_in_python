Please note that python LSNM is NOT compatible\r\n     with either Python 2.6 or Python 3.0.\r\n\r\n   * Python modules matplotlib, re, random, math, numpy, sys, and\r\n     PyQt4, pandas, among other scientific computation modules. My\r\n     advice is to download Anaconda Python, freely available\r\n     from continuum.io, which contains Python 2.7 and a full set\r\n     of modules commonly used in scientific computation.\r\n     \r\n   * The Virtual Brain Python modules, located at the TVB github\r\n     repository at https://github.com/the-virtual-brain. You will\r\n     need to clone the directories 'tvb-library' and 'tvb-data'\r\n     and install it locally so that your Python installation is\r\n     able to see the location of such modules. Please refer to the\r\n     instructions provided in the github repository on how to cleanly\r\n     install TVB. Also, refer to the 'Alternate installation: the user\r\n     scheme' at https://docs.python.org/2/install/, for\r\n     instructions on how to install python modules locally when\r\n     you don't have 'write' permission to global-site packages (e.g.,\r\n     you are only a user in a Unix system an do not have a 'root'\r\n     or 'su' password. If the ‘Alternate installation’ does not work, please\r\n     refer to the “Installing Python modules” in the lsnm_in_python\r\n     wiki page, at https://github.com/NIDCD/lsnm_in_python/wiki/Installing-Python-modules.\r\n",
