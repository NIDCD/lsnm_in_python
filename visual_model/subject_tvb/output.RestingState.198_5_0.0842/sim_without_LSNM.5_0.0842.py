# Simulates resting brain activity using Wilson Cowan model and 998 nodes, as
# seen in Hagmann et al (2008).
# The activation of state variable E and I are collected at each time step
# of the simulation and are written out to a data file that can be accessed
# later. Synaptic activities in of E and I populations are also collected
# and saved to a file
#
# Additionnally, it finds closest TVB nodes given a set of LSNM module locations
# in Talairach coordinates
