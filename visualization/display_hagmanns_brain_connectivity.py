# Displays Hagmann's brain's 998-nodes plus LSNM nodes, along with the connections
# between Hagmann's nodes and LSNM nodes.
#
# The LSNM nodes to display can be defined in the code itself using Tailarach coordinates
# and can be motor, visual, or auditory. Perhaps in the future I will make this an option
# you can select from at run-time?
